## Questions

### Why this project is created
With poooi/poi#1542 we introduced a contributor graph on readme, but this graph is not complete since the contribution data only go from poooi/poi repo, and we are missing:
- contributors that do not directly send commit to the project
- contributors from other repo, e.g. plugins

### How are the contributors ordered
SeasonÂçÉ is the creator for poi project icon, and edwardaaaa contributed the vector art icons. Following are contributors for code, art works and themes, sorted by first commit day

### Is this data complete?
Please contact us if there're still efforts and contributions that have not been accounted in the data

### I find something wrong / I want to modify my data
Contributors always have right to customize name, avatar and homepage in this data, please tell us if you like to do so.
